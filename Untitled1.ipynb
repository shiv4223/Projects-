              "'professor hiram dexter put the finishing touches on his toilet by\\ntenderly brushing out his crisp, black vandyke beard. he stepped back\\nto look at himself in the mirror. he had to stoop a little for even the\\nfull-length glass was short for his six feet four inches of gangling\\nheight. nevertheless he regarded his image with undiluted satisfaction.\\n\\n\"ah, dexter,\" he sighed, \"you\\'re a dashing rascal.\"\\n\\nhumming tunelessly, for he was quite tone-deaf, he picked up a book\\ntitled, \"the nutritive quotient, vitamin factors and trace elements of\\nprotein-high diets,\" put his hat on, the light out, and left the house.\\n\\noutside, a spring night hovered tenderly over the campus of fredonia\\ncollege. the darkness was alive with the richness of new grass,\\nthe vagrant perfumes of verbena, alyssum, calendula, nemophila and\\nageratum, not to mention lobelia, mignonette, nicotiana, scabiosa,\\nkochia and salpiglossis. he knew them all and loved every latin\\nsyllable.\\n\\nhis nostrils dilated with pleasure as he strode, with a loose, almost\\nclanking motion, along the concrete paths. it was a night for romance,\\nfor tender, whispered discussions of vitamins and tissue regeneration,\\nof gamma rays and the atom.\\n\\nprofessor dexter\\'s heart welled with the rich pathos of life. as\\nstraight as the curving paths would allow, he headed directly for the\\nneat brick house where dwelt his lady love: professor clarissa wilkins,\\nof the domestic science department.\\n\\nat the foot of her steps, a shadow loomed out of the dark. it was a\\nvery short, barrel-shaped shadow. prof. dexter leaned over from his\\ngreat height, to peer at it.\\n\\n\"ah--is that you, donald?\" he queried.\\n\\n\"who were you expecting?\" snapped the tubby shadow peevishly.\\n\"hirohito?\"\\n\\nprofessor donald curtis was in almost every way the opposite of his\\nfriend hiram dexter. he was five feet two inches in his elevator shoes\\nand his circumference was better than that by two or three inches. he\\nwas as quick, and jumpy in his movements as a chipmunk and he seemed to\\nbuzz around the taller, slower-moving man like an irritated bumble-bee.\\nnevertheless they were fast friends, rivals only in their physics\\nresearch--and for the hand of professor clarissa wilkins.\\n\\nthey turned and ascended the steps together. professor curtis clutched\\nto his plump bosom a book titled: \"a statistical history of the\\nnutritional influence upon intelligence of the child from one to six.\"\\nneither were greeks, but they both came bearing gifts subtly slanted to\\ntheir beloved\\'s tastes.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nprofessor dexter pressed the doorbell and a muted chime rang softly\\nwithin. the door opened and light bathed them, pressing back the soft\\ndarkness of the spring night.\\n\\n\"good evening, professor,\" professor dexter said, beaming at the lady\\nin the doorway.\\n\\n\"good evening, professor,\" professor curtis echoed, smiling broadly.\\n\\n\"oh, it\\'s you,\" professor wilkins said. if this had been the south she\\nwould have said you-all.\\n\\nclarissa was an energetic spinster in her forties with snapping black\\neyes, graying hair drawn into a neat, no-nonsense bun at the back\\nof her head and the most remarkable grasp of bio-chemistry of any\\nwoman alive. professors dexter and curtis admired her intellectual\\nattainments extravagantly and mistook the admiration for love.\\n\\nshe let them in, accepted their gifts with a murmured thanks and waved\\nthem vaguely to chairs. she seemed a little absent-minded, a bit\\ndistracted this evening.\\n\\nprofessor dexter cleared his throat.\\n\\n\"a most amusing thing happened in class today,\" he began. \"i was\\nlecturing--\"\\n\\n\"that was amusing enough,\" professor curtis snapped testily.\\n\"professor--er--clarissa,\" he said daringly, \"referring to the\\nstefansson experiments in living on meat alone for a year--\"\\n\\n\"by the way,\" interrupted professor dexter, \"i don\\'t see any of\\nthose--er--those delicious cookies you make so well, professor.\\nthose--ah--little brown ones with the chocolate chips in them.\"\\n\\nhe was peering around anxiously.\\n\\na flicker of emotion crossed clarissa\\'s face, but was gone at once. she\\nrose.\\n\\n\"i\\'ll get them.\"\\n\\nshe returned bearing a plate heaped high with crisp, crunchy,\\nchocolated cookies. the professors\\' eyes lighted. they reached.\\n\\nprofessor dexter hurried into the conversational breach, impolitely not\\neven waiting for his mastication to cease.\\n\\n\"a most amusing thing happened in class today,\" he repeated.\\n\\nthe doorbell chimed.\\n\\nanticipation lighted up professor wilkins\\' cool gray eyes. she went to\\nthe door and presently returned with a man in tow.\\n\\n\"professor dexter, professor curtis, you know mr. donahue, our athletic\\ndirector.\"\\n\\nthey knew jake donahue. they did not approve of mere muscle, without\\nmind. they gave his powerful, athletic figure, his rugged, square-jawed\\nface a disapproving glance.\\n\\n\"how d\\'ye do?\" they said.\\n\\n\"hi!\" said jake donahue.\\n\\nhe sat down. clarissa transferred the plate of cookies to his side.\\nhe munched. and a surprising thing happened. mere muscle could never\\ntriumph over intellect, yet the professors dexter and curtis found\\nthemselves pocketed, side-tracked and elbowed aside.\\n\\nthe conversation was of football, racing, track, crew, basketball,\\npole-vaulting, shot-putting, boxing, swimming, wrestling, baseball,\\nnot to neglect tennis, skeet-shooting, ice-skating, skiing, horseback\\nriding, lacrosse, bob-sledding, jai-alai, handball and billiards.\\n\\nthey took it for an hour. then they folded their tents like the arabs\\nand as silently withdrew. the final blow was that clarissa hardly\\nseemed to know they were departing.\\n\\ndefeated, they stared at one another, when outside. the spring night\\nwas still fulsome with perfume and romance. but the joy had gone from\\ntheir hearts, the glamour was an empty, mocking shell.\\n\\n\"this may be new to us, professor, but it is a familiar thing,\" curtis\\nsaid as they began to walk down the path. \"the female of the species\\nwishes to be conquered. hence, whatever her intellectual endowments,\\ninstinct triumphs over intellect and she succumbs to the animal\\nmagnetism of brute force.\"\\n\\n\"but it\\'s clarissa!\" professor dexter said weakly.\\n\\n\"even clarissa. oh, of course if she married him she would soon awake\\nto her horrible mistake. she would weary of an endless conversation\\nabout basketball and foot racing. she would yearn for the rarified\\nheights of our discussions. but it would be too late.\"\\n\\n\"we must rescue her from this tragic error, professor,\" dexter said\\nfirmly.\\n\\n\"yes,\" curtis agreed. \"how? did you ever try to change clarissa\\'s mind?\"\\n\\n\"uh--once.\" professor dexter shuddered at the memory. \"it was worse\\nthan my fraternity initiation--which i still remember with revulsion\\nafter twenty-six years.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nthey walked in moody silence for a while, professor curtis skipping to\\nkeep up with his friend\\'s loose-jointed stride. then professor dexter\\nstopped with an exclamation.\\n\\n\"there is a way!\" he said. \"look. it seems obvious that what clarissa\\nadmires in this jake donahue is not his conversation but his\\noverwhelmingly masculine physique. do you agree?\"\\n\\ncurtis grunted. his own figure was a sore spot with him.\\n\\n\"against jake donahue--let us face it--we do not cut inspiring\\nfigures. i am too tall and you are too short. but suppose we were\\nto change--suppose i were to come down four or five inches and fill\\nout correspondingly and you were to come up ten inches and slim out\\ncorrespondingly? then how would we compare with donahue?\"\\n\\nprofessor curtis stared at him angrily.\\n\\n\"there may be something wrong with my ears, but i doubt it,\" he\\nsnapped. \"i think i heard you say what i heard you say. and i wish to\\npoint out, with bitterness, that this is hardly the time for fanciful\\npleasantries.\"\\n\\n\"nonsense!\" professor dexter said. \"i am not joking. we have the means\\nin our grasp. come along with me and i\\'ll show you.\"\\n\\nhe hurried the protesting curtis along, the little man\\'s feet fairly\\nflying to keep up. at the darkened physics building, dexter used his\\nkey and let them in. they went up to the laboratory.\\n\\n\"you know my work on the atom,\" dexter said. \"i have never boasted\\nof my part in atomic fission which resulted in the atom bomb. i was\\npledged to secrecy but there is no harm in telling you what you have\\ndoubtless guessed, that i was one of the physicists whose work on\\nuranium made the bomb possible.\"\\n\\ncurtis nodded. there was no jealousy in him, only the true scientists\\'\\nappreciation of a good job well done. he was dexter\\'s staunchest\\nbooster.\\n\\n\"what i have done,\" professor dexter said, snapping on the lights\\nin his laboratory, \"is to shift my research away from destructive\\nmetallurgy and turn the light of new atom discoveries upon protoplasmic\\ntissue. if the atoms of metal can be shifted, altered or broken apart,\\nwhy not living tissue?\"\\n\\n\"because your subject would die, obviously,\" curtis replied.\\n\\n\"they did, at first,\" dexter admitted. \"the reason was that the\\ncyclotron--\" he waved at a hulking monster which looked like two giant\\nswiss cheeses lying flat, one above the other \"--was much too powerful\\nto use on living things. the problem was to use less power, apply it\\nmore slowly, yet retain the ability to move the electrons about the\\nnucleus.\"\\n\\nexcitement began to pop in professor curtis\\' voluable face.\\n\\n\"you did it?\" he stammered.\\n\\n\"i did it. needing only reduced power, i scaled down the cyclotron and\\nincorporated the electron stream in this cathode tube. what i have here\\nis essentially a pocket-sized cyclotron which i am satisfied will have\\nno lethal effect upon living tissue.\"\\n\\n\"but what will it do?\"\\n\\nprofessor dexter shrugged bony shoulders.\\n\\n\"anything. by exerting the proper kind of force on the electrons i can\\ncrowd them together, thus reducing anything in size. by bombarding\\nthem with a different intensity i can cause them to repel each other\\nand thus increase the size of the subject. or--i could simply alter his\\nappearance by shifting the arrangement of the atom, or by knocking out\\nsome of the electrons which would change his chemical composition.\"\\n\\n\"then you can actually make us smaller or larger?\"\\n\\n\"i am convinced of it. i never intended, nor expected, to put the\\nmachine to such frivolous uses. i had dedicated it to pure science.\\nbut what is science, after all, but a tool which man should use for a\\nbetter life? and our lives are now affected, professor. we must use\\nscience to solve our own problems.\"\\n\\n\"admirably put.\"\\n\\nprofessor dexter laid his hand on a huge shining cathode tube, whose\\nterminal ends were clamped in the shining copper embrace of a massive\\ninduction coil.\\n\\n\"to be fair, we will need two of these. we will both undergo the\\nexperiment simultaneously--you to grow, i to shrink. will you take the\\nrisk, professor?\"\\n\\ncurtis clasped his hand.\\n\\n\"gladly.\"\\n\\n\"then i shall build another apparatus and as soon as it is finished we\\nwill complete the experiment.\"\\n\\n\"i will help you, professor,\" curtis exclaimed.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nworking feverishly, they completed the job in a week. two identical\\nmachines stood near each other on the lab floor, shining cathode tubes\\npoised like a pair of futuristic ray guns.\\n\\nin all this time they had no word from professor clarissa wilkins.\\n\\n\"probably baking cookies for jake donahue,\" dexter said bitterly.\\n\\n\"if he eats enough of them he\\'ll get fat and lose his figure,\" curtis\\nsaid. \"but it would take too long.\"\\n\\nthey finished early one afternoon and by common consent made their\\nplans to go through with the experiment the next morning. though\\nneither man would admit it they were just a little scared. they went\\nhome and made their wills. each left everything they possessed to\\nclarissa.\\n\\nearly the next morning, before the campus was astir with class-bound\\nstudents, they met at the laboratory. the grass sparkled with dew and\\nall the freshness and sweetness of a spring morning tugged at their\\nhearts. professor dexter had circles of sleeplessness under his eyes\\nand professor curtis\\' chubby face was drawn and haggard.\\n\\nthey entered the laboratory. professor dexter set the automatic timers\\non both machines. they shook hands gravely, then, unable to find words,\\ntook their places silently under the gleaming eyes of the cathode\\ntubes. together they raised their hands and depressed the switches.\\n\\ndeep in the basement a generator sprang to life and faintly they sensed\\nthe deep rumble of its movement. the coolidge tubes awoke as the stream\\nof electrons impinged upon the platinum target plates. and then the\\nshock of induced rays struck them, sank into them, seemed to flow and\\nspread to every tissue and cell.\\n\\nsomething was happening to professor hiram dexter. he felt, first of\\nall, a sudden surge of nausea that rocked him on his long legs. his\\nstomach twisted and a paralyzing weakness turned his muscles to water\\nand made the lab swim unsteadily before his eyes.\\n\\nat the same moment he felt a definite shrinking effect. his limbs\\nbecame suddenly heavy. he felt in the grip of a vastly increased\\ngravity, like a man going swiftly upward in a fast elevator. he was\\nunable to move because of the strange weight of his arms and legs.\\n\\nthen, to his horror, he saw the coolidge tube sliding swiftly up out\\nof his line of vision. the edge of the lab table came up, passed his\\neyeline and began to recede toward the ceiling. he was shrinking, but\\ntoo fast and too far!\\n\\neven in that moment of undisguised terror, his scientist\\'s mind noted\\nthat his clothes shrank with him. the ray worked on them as well as his\\nliving tissue.\\n\\nsteadying his reeling vision, he searched wildly for professor curtis.\\nfar across the huge expanse of rough, pitted lumber which the lab floor\\nhad suddenly become, were two shoes the size of the queen elizabeth.\\nfrom them two colossal legs, each like the washington monument, soared\\ninto the sky. he could see only just past the knees. the rest of the\\ntorso loomed into the distance. the ceiling was unthinkable distances\\nbeyond.\\n\\nthere came the click of the automatic timer. the power went off and\\nthe coolidge tube subsided into lifelessness. the potent stream of\\nelectrons ceased.\\n\\nslowly the nausea lifted. he could breathe again. he stared around\\nhim, terrified at the huge, strange cavern he was in. judging from the\\napparent girth of chair legs and similar objects near him, he was about\\nthree inches tall! the fleeting thought crossed his mind. if a mouse\\nshould come across him now! what a terrifying carnivore it would be!\\n\\nbut this was not the worst. he could not move. at first the dreadful\\nthought came that the rays had somehow paralyzed him. but there was no\\nnumbness in his muscles. they were simply too heavy to lift themselves.\\nhe stood as immobile as though he had been nailed to the floor.\\n\\nacross the room professor curtis was having his troubles. the ceiling\\nhad shot down to him as it had to alice-in-wonderland when she had\\ndrunk the little bottle labeled, \"drink me.\"\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\nhe had hastily stooped to keep from bashing his head and he had to keep\\non stooping more and more until he was bent more than halfway over\\nbefore the click of the automatic timer released him.\\n\\n\"this is a little too much of a good thing,\" he muttered and was\\nstartled at the sound of his own voice. it was light and fluttery with\\na sound like soap bubbles bursting in midair.\\n\\n\"professor!\" he called. \"professor dexter! where are you?\"\\n\\nthe tiniest of squeaks came up to him. still feeling light-headed and\\ndizzy, curtis searched the area carefully. with horror he spotted at\\nlast, the diminutive, toy-like figure of his friend.\\n\\nhe took a careful step forward. his limbs seemed to float, with little\\neffort, which was fortunate, for he felt as weak as though he had just\\nemerged from a long illness.\\n\\nthen he realized there was only one way to get close. he lay down flat\\non the floor, doubling up at knees and waist and got his face close to\\nthe tiny figure of dexter.\\n\\n\"get me out of here!\" the mannikin squeaked painfully. \"start the\\nmachine and reverse it!\"\\n\\nprofessor curtis clambered to his feet.\\n\\nif clarissa could see us now, he thought. i am twenty feet tall and\\nprofessor dexter is three inches tall. what a pair!\\n\\nweakly he lumbered back to his machine and reached for the control.\\nthen, crowning horror of horrors! the lever sank right into his hand!\\n\\nit hurt like the devil too, and he pulled back his arm with a yelp of\\npain. carefully he tried again. and again the solid metal seemed to\\npush right through the flesh.\\n\\ndazed, frightened, he cautiously tried to touch other objects. there\\nwas always the same result. everything penetrated his tissues like a\\nneedle going through cloth. yet he did not bleed.\\n\\nterrified, he went down on his stomach to report this new catastrophe\\nto professor dexter. the shrunken scientist groaned.\\n\\n\"that was the one thing i forgot,\" he squeaked. \"i forgot that no\\nmatter how i altered the size of the atoms in our bodies, the mass\\nwould remain the same. thus i am now so heavy that i cannot move. you\\nare so light that you have no strength and your atoms are so dispersed\\nthat solid objects penetrate your tissues and you cannot move the\\nswitch. we are trapped, professor curtis, trapped like miserable rats\\nin a cage!\"\\n\\nthere was a timeless moment of despair during which the two pioneers\\nstared at each other in hopeless terror. only professor curtis saw a\\nmere pinpoint of white face too small for features, while professor\\ndexter saw a huge floating blob of a planet like the full moon looming\\nover him.\\n\\nthere was a sudden and welcome interruption. the door banged and\\nclarissa wilkins\\' crisp efficient voice came to their ears.\\n\\n\"what\\'s going on in here?\" she demanded. \"professor curtis, is that\\nyou? what have you been doing to yourself? get up off the floor!\"\\n\\n\"careful!\" professor curtis panted, beginning to unjoint himself.\\n\"don\\'t step on professor dexter!\"\\n\\n\"step on him? my heavens, where is he?\"\\n\\n\"she wouldn\\'t hurt me if she did,\" dexter groaned to himself. \"probably\\nbreak her foot.\"\\n\\n\"clarissa--er--professor wilkins, turn on the machine for us!\" curtis\\ngasped, pointing wildly to the starting switch.\\n\\n\"tell her to reverse the polarity!\" dexter squeaked.\\n\\nclarissa snorted as she moved purposely toward the machine.\\n\\n\"i always thought you two theorists were too childlike to be left\\nalone,\" she snapped. \"i knew you\\'d get into trouble and need a woman to\\nget you out!\"\\n\\nefficiently she reversed and started the machine as professor curtis\\nstepped into the path of the rays. before her startled eyes he\\nshrank--shrank--shrank back to his normal elevator-shoed tubbiness, and\\nthe timer clicked off the machine.\\n\\nwith a gasp of relief, professor curtis leaped forward and did the\\nnecessary for dexter\\'s machine. to clarissa\\'s even greater wonder,\\ndexter grew rapidly out of the floor and shot up into his normal\\ngangling six feet four.\\n\\nboth scientists faced each other with beads of sweat on their brows.\\ntheir hands met silently.\\n\\n\"when you two get through admiring one another, i\\'ll tell you what i\\ncame here for,\" clarissa said crisply. \"i just wanted you to know that\\ni am going to marry mr. donahue!\"\\n\\nthey heard her go, but the sense of loss did not come. the sense of\\nrelief persisted.\\n\\n\"she\\'s a wonderful woman,\" professor curtis said softly.\\n\\n\"yes,\" agreed professor dexter. \"but you see now what difficulties this\\nmating instinct is apt to bring on? this insane desire to please an\\nillogical woman? professor curtis we have had a narrow escape!\"\\n\\n\"you are right,\" curtis said gloomily.\\n\\n\"besides,\" professor dexter sighed, \"i think it was those chocolate\\nchip cookies she baked so well that i was really in love with. i am\\ngoing to miss them.\"\\n\\n\"maybe she\\'ll let us drop around some evenings and she\\'ll bake us\\nsome,\" curtis suggested.\\n\\ntheir eyes brightened. all was not
